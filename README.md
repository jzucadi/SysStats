### Menu Bar Display

<img width="164" height="35" alt="Menu Bar Stats" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fbdcf2a-889f-402c-983d-ad57c46a9ce3" />

The menu bar shows real-time system metrics in a compact format:

| Icon | Metric |
|------|--------|
| 🖥️ | CPU usage percentage |
| 🧊 | GPU usage percentage |
| 💾 | RAM usage percentage |
| 🌡️ | Temperature (°C or °F) |

### Popover Details

Click the menu bar item to see:
- Detailed stats with progress bars
- Color-coded usage levels (green/yellow/red)
- Gear icon to access preferences
- Quit button

### Preferences

Access preferences via the gear icon in the popover:

- **Update Interval** - 1s, 2s, or 5s refresh rate

- **Launch at Login** - Start automatically on login

## Requirements

- **macOS 13.0 (Ventura) or later**
- **Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) or Intel Mac** - Temperature monitoring works best on Apple Silicon
- **Xcode 15.0+** (for building from source)

## Installation

### Option 1: Download Pre-built Binary (Recommended)

1. Download the latest release DMG from the [Releases](https://github.com/jzucadi/SysStats/releases) page
2. Open the DMG file
3. Drag `SysStats.app` to your Applications folder
4. Launch SysStats from Applications
5. Grant necessary permissions when prompted

### Option 2: Build from Source

See [Building from Source](#building-from-source) section below.

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- macOS 13.0 or later
- Xcode 15.0 or later
- A valid Apple Developer account (for code signing)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jzucadi/SysStats.git
   cd SysStats
   ```

2. **Open in Xcode:**
   ```bash
   open SysStats.xcodeproj
   ```

3. **Configure code signing:**
   - Select the SysStats project in Xcode
   - Go to "Signing & Capabilities" tab
   - Select your development team
   - Ensure "Automatically manage signing" is enabled

4. **Build and run:**
   - Press `⌘R` or select Product → Run
   - The app will launch in your menu bar

### Building for Release

For a release build with optimizations:

```bash
# Build release version
./scripts/build-release.sh 1.0

# Create distributable DMG
./scripts/create-dmg.sh 1.0
```

The built app will be in `build/Build/Products/Release/` and the DMG in `dist/`.

## Usage

### First Launch

1. Launch SysStats from Applications or the menu bar
2. Grant necessary permissions:
   - **Accessibility** (for full functionality)
   - **Screen Recording** (if prompted, for temperature monitoring)

### Menu Bar

The stats appear in your menu bar in the format: `C:45% G:12% R:67% 42°`

Click the menu bar item to:
- View detailed stats with visual progress bars
- Access preferences (gear icon)
- Quit the application

### Customization

Click the gear icon in the popover to customize:
- Which metrics to display
- Update frequency (1s, 2s, or 5s)
- Temperature unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit)
- Launch at login behavior

## Architecture

SysStats is built with modern Swift and SwiftUI, using the following architecture:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `SysStatsApp` | SwiftUI app entry point |
| `AppDelegate` | Status bar setup and Combine observation pipeline |
| `StatsManager` | Async metrics fetching with configurable update intervals |
| `SystemStats` | Low-level IOKit-based CPU, GPU, RAM, and temperature reading |
| `PreferencesManager` | UserDefaults-backed settings storage with @Published properties |
| `HelperManager` | XPC communication manager for privileged operations |
| `SysStatsHelper` | Privileged XPC helper for secure temperature sensor access on Apple Silicon |
| `ContentView` | SwiftUI popover interface with real-time updates |

### Key Technologies

- **SwiftUI** - Modern declarative UI framework
- **Combine** - Reactive programming for state management
- **IOKit** - Low-level system information access
- **SMC (System Management Controller)** - Temperature and thermal sensor data
- **XPC Services** - Secure inter-process communication for privileged operations
- **SMJobBless** - Privileged helper installation for secure temperature access

### Temperature Monitoring

Temperature reading on Apple Silicon requires privileged access to SMC (System Management Controller). SysStats uses a privileged helper tool (`SysStatsHelper`) that:
- Runs as a separate XPC service with elevated privileges
- Communicates securely via XPC protocol
- Only provides temperature data (principle of least privilege)
- Must be properly signed with a Developer ID for production use

## Distribution

### Signing and Notarization

For public distribution, your app must be signed and notarized by Apple:

1. **Sign the app with Developer ID:**
   ```bash
   codesign --deep --force --verify --verbose \
     --sign "Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAM_ID)" \
     --options runtime \
     dist/SysStats.app
   ```

2. **Create a signed DMG:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/create-dmg.sh 1.0
   codesign --sign "Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAM_ID)" \
     dist/SysStats-1.0.dmg
   ```

3. **Notarize with Apple:**
   ```bash
   xcrun notarytool submit dist/SysStats-1.0.dmg \
     --apple-id your@email.com \
     --team-id TEAM_ID \
     --password APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD \
     --wait
   ```

4. **Staple the notarization:**
   ```bash
   xcrun stapler staple dist/SysStats-1.0.dmg
   ```

### Hardened Runtime

The app is configured with Hardened Runtime for enhanced security. Required entitlements are defined in `SysStats.entitlements`.

**Important:** The privileged helper (`SysStatsHelper`) requires proper signing with a Developer ID certificate for SMJobBless to work on end-user machines. Development builds may have limited temperature monitoring functionality.

## Troubleshooting

### Temperature shows "—°" or is not updating

**Cause:** The privileged helper is not properly installed or signed.

**Solution:**
- For development builds, temperature monitoring may not work without proper signing
- For release builds, ensure the helper is signed with a valid Developer ID
- Try restarting the app
- Check Console.app for XPC communication errors

### App doesn't show in menu bar

**Cause:** The app may have crashed or failed to launch.

**Solution:**
- Check Activity Monitor for the SysStats process
- Look for crash logs in Console.app
- Try deleting preferences: `defaults delete com.example.SysStats`
- Rebuild and reinstall the app

### Stats show 0% or incorrect values

**Cause:** Permissions issue or IOKit access problem.

**Solution:**
- Grant all requested permissions in System Settings → Privacy & Security
- Restart the app after granting permissions
- Check Console.app for error messages related to IOKit

### App won't launch after installation

**Cause:** macOS Gatekeeper blocking unsigned or unnotarized app.

**Solution:**
- Right-click the app and select "Open"
- Or run: `xattr -cr /Applications/SysStats.app`
- For release builds, ensure proper signing and notarization

### High CPU usage

**Cause:** Update interval set too low or system monitoring overhead.

**Solution:**
- Increase update interval to 2s or 5s in preferences
- Reduce the number of displayed metrics
- Check for other system monitoring tools that may conflict
